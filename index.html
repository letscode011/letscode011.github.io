    <h1>My Guitar Journey</h1>
    <p>I started playing guitar in December 2019. which is 6 months from now, at first it was hard to play it as the strings of the instruments were hurting my fingers.<br>
        I started following some youtubers and learned from them the basics of guitar. <br>After that I learned some popular Bolloywood songs like bekhayali etc. while my first hollywood song was "My heart will go on".
